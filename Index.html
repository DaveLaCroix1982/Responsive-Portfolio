		<p>My name is Dave LaCroix, I am originally from south east Michigan, I can show you on my hand upon request. I moved to Charlotte NC back in 2009 and have been living here ever since. I graduated from Central Michigan University in 2007 with degree in business management, over the last 10 years I have had various jobs in the construction industry everything from Selling business to business to working in a crawlspace digging french drains. I have recently changed my career path to build things with my mind on the internet rather than with my body in or under a house. 
		 </p>
	   <p>I have always enjoyed the satisfaction of seeing a competed project on a home, I look forward to the same sense of accomplishment creating and designing web sites. 
		 </p>
		<p>Iâ€™m currently looking for my next project to create, please reach out with any inquires.
